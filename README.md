In this article, I'll walk you through the tasks I performed, highlighting potential use in a real-world business scenario with some samples provided.

## < Top 10 Selling Products >
   Imagine you're the manager of an online store, and you want to know which products are the top sellers. To achieve this challenge, finding the top 10 products based on their sales, calculated by multiplying the quantity sold by the price. This information could be a game-changer for inventory management, ensuring that popular products are always in stock, so the business stock could have enough products for every product.

## < Top 3 Products Sales by Store >
  In this task, the goal is aimed to assist store managers in understanding the local customer preferences. By identifying the top-selling products in each store based on their location, store managers can tailor their inventory to match the unique demands of their specific market. This data-driven approach can increase sales and enhance customer satisfaction.

## < Ranking Store Performance >
   Imagine you're a regional manager overseeing multiple stores. It's essential to know which stores are thriving and which ones may need improvement. Ranking the stores based on their performance, enabling businesses to allocate resources more effectively and high-performing locations.

## < Purchasing Habits by Gender >
  Generally, marketing and sales teams need to understand how customers prefer to make purchases. Creating a table that displays the purchasing method (online or in-store) by gender, can guide targeted marketing campaigns and promotions. For instance, if more males shop in-store, businesses can design strategies to attract more male customers to physical locations.

## < Tracking Monthly Total Sales >
  Every business relies on steady revenue streams. Tracking monthly sales figures is crucial for financial planning, budgeting, and assessing overall business health. By presenting the total sales for each month, businesses can identify trends, seasonality, and fluctuations in their revenue.
